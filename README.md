About Me Quiz

This app is an interactive guessing game where users answer questions about the creator's personal background and interests. Users are prompted with questions related to the creator's education, job experience, and life goals, aiming to test their knowledge and engage them in an informative and entertaining experience. Additionally, it has two guessing games: one is a "guess the number" game, and the other is a "guess a country that I would like to visit" game. At the end, users are scored to see how many questions they got right.

### Reflections and Comments

Changed the page layout to be simple and added some images to the webpage. I really struggled with how everything was going to fit, so I just scrapped the old layout and made this new one.

-First time I actually researched CSS styles, and I'm impressed by what I can do with it. I also had trouble figuring out how to link files to the main HTML file, but I realized that I need to include the path to the other files, so everything worked out.
